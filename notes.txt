... Needle? What can I do with a needle...

What about a little platformer game where you have to pop balloons
with a big ass needle?

might be a bit too clich√© but let's do that now.

My other inmediate thought was the Petscop needles piano, but IDK
if that even counts

Oh wait I didn't see the theme was necromancy! DAMN

Now how do I fit those together...
